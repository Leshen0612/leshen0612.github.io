excerpt: 'Early and late transition metals are often combined as a strategy to tune the selectivity of catalysts for the conversion of syngas (CO/H2) to C2+ oxygenates, such as ethanol. Here we show how the use of a highly reducible Fe2O3 support for Rh leads to the in situ formation of supported FeRh nanoalloy catalysts that exhibit high selectivity for ethanol synthesis.'
