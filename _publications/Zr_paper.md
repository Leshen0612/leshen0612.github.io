title: "Preparation and Structural Characterization of ZrO2/CuOx/Cu(111) Inverse Model Catalysts"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is regarded as a promising reaction to catalytically convert a major greenhouse gas (CO2) into a value-added product (methanol). In the current study, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied to investigate the growth mode of low coverages (<0.2 ML) of ZrO2 in an inverse ZrO2/CuOx/Cu(111) system, which has the potential to achieve high selectivity for a direct CO2-to-methanol transformation.'
