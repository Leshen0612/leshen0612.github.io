title: "Growth and structural studies of In/Au(111) alloys and InOx/Au(111) inverse oxide/metal model catalysts"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/In_paper
excerpt: 'Indium oxide has received attention as an exciting candidate for catalyzing the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol due to its high selectivity (>80%). Compared to the extent of research on the activity of indium oxide-based powder catalysts, very little is known about the phenomena associated with the formation of surface alloys involving indium or the growth mechanism for indium oxide nanoparticles. In this report, scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to elucidate the growth mode, structure, and chemical state of In/Au(111) alloys and InOx/Au(111) inverse model catalysts.
