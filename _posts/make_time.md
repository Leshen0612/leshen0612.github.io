# Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky

## High-level Thoughts
It's not a book about productivity and how to get thing done. It's a book to teach you how to focus on the things really matters in your life.

## Summary Notes
Although we have already seen tons of books discussing how to finish as many things as possible efficiently (the method GTD), Jake and JZ (the authors of _Make Time_) introduced us a new path, which is to focus on only one thing each day (referred as _Highlight_ in the book). In the beginning, they described the "default settings" of human beings lived in 21st century on _Busy Bandwagon and _Infinity Pool_. We can think of the __Busy Bandwagon__ the mode when we are working: overflowing inboxes, full calendars and the endless to-do lists. And the __Infinity Pool__ is the mode when we got a period or even a second of free time: refresh Twitter, browse YouTube... The reason we call these behaviors "default" is because everyone nowadays seems to follow the same way; we got overwhelmed at work and stare at the screen in the spare time, but just like the default settings in the new phone you bought, this can be changed.
However, most of the to-do lists are just someone else's priority, not ours. Even for the only time we have to work on our priorities can be stolen by the attractions on our screen. In this book, JZ and Jake introduced a systematic pathway to make time for the things we care about. These things do not need to be work related or some other tasks to improve ourselves. Instead, it could be clean the apartment, or even cook a dinner for our family. One important thing for choosing a highlight is that it should be finished within 1~2 hours. The first step is to choose the thing you wanna focus on that day, which is called a __Highlight__. Then in order to finish that highlight, we need to turn on the "__Laser__" mode and beat the distraction while you achieve your highlight. And when we are focusing on the highlight, our brain need __Energy__ so we need some tactics to take care of our body. The last step is __Reflection__ to improve your system at the end of the day. In the book, the authors list some tactics that might be useful for all these four steps. Here I will write down some that would work for me in this period.

### Highlight
- Write It Down
The authors provide templates on the website: [clean look](https://maketime.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Make-Time-Notes-simple-1.pdf) and [hand_drawn format](https://maketime.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Make-Time-Notes-hand-drawn.pdf)
- Stack Rank Your Life
- Schedule Your Highlight
You could put your highlight on the calendar
- Just say no
Say no to the events your are not interested. 
- Design Your Day
Design on the calendar ahead and make adjustment anytime

### Laser
- Distraction-Free Phone
Delete the unnecessary apps. Turn off all the notifications for example emails
__*This really works for me. My screen time was cut to half after this and I do not check my phone that often*__
- Clear Your Home Screen
Now iphone has a good function is to put all the apps in library. I only left 4 apps that are not related to distraction. For example: google map, dictionary
- Leave Devices Behind
- Skip the Morning Check-in
I used to check my emails right after I wake up and all the updates on _weibo_. Now I only check my emails around 11am and 4pm. And I deleted _weibo_.
- Ignore the News
News are happening all the time but not all of the will have a giant impact in your life. So I read news related journals once a week such as _The Economist_
- Fly Without WiFi
A flight trip can give you a long period of time to work on your highlight. Although due to the COVID-19, I will not have travel opportunities recently, but it's a good tactic for future.
- Schedule Email Time
- Be Slow to Respond
- Invent a Deadline
Although your highlight does not have a deadline, it will inspire you when you set a deadline by yourself.
- Avoid the Lure of Fancy Tools
- Start on Paper
- Make a "Random Question List"
When you are focusing on your highlight, you may get distracted by some random questions, like I need to buy something on Amazon or what will I cook for dinner. Now you could write down these questions on a piece of paper and think about it after the work.

### Energize
- Exercise Every Day (but Don't Be a Hero)
- Eat like a Hunter-Gatherer
- Central Park your Plate
- Stay Hungry
- Go on the Dark Chocolate Plan
__Less Sugar!__
- Trick Yourself into Meditating
- Leave Your Headphone at home
Give your brain a rest
- Eat Without Screen
Can not achieve right now.
